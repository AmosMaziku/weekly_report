WEEKLY PROGRESS REPORT  MACHINE LEARNING IPT-2018

In the first week I have learn general concept of machine learning, such as why machine learning?, what problem can machine learning solve?. 
Also I learn the concept of python version 2.7 and version 3.6 in machine learning.  

Another thing I learn is important packages that are used in machine learning such as anaconda, pytorch, tensorflow, and etc. 
Even the important packages with there installation such as scikit-learn, jupyter notebook, pandas metaplotlib and etc. 
The simple application of the machine learning through Iris datasets I saw how the machine  learning implemented and how those important packages and libraries are used.

Also I saw different algorithms that used and  implemented by the machine  learning so as to produce the accurate out put. 
I learn how to use those algorithms and why do we use algorithms and also the data use by each algorithm and how to implement those algorithms 

conclusion:

Above are elaborated short summary on what on this week, also I found many of new concept in this course of machine learning but through the weekly challenge I learn a lot on how I can use our learned algorithms with the real  world examples datasets.
